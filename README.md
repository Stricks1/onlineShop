# onlineShop

In this project I choose to created a music online shop with a 'main with search' and 'results' page. 
I used a lot of knowledge acquired throughout the HTML & CSS section, such as semantic html, positioning of content with bootstrap and flexbox among others. Also for learning purposes and to see if I could use different frameworks used 'Flickity' to build a carousel (just on a minor element to see it working, didn't want to abuse it because I wanted to show more CSS skills learned throught Microverse HTML & CSS section).
Worked for the requirements on two different main versions, showing the content as required, one for fullscreen >= 768px another for < 768px. I saw that I could improve it a little more on smaller screens, so I worked with some adjustments when a screen became less than 576px.
