# HTML & CSS Capstone Project. A responsive Music Shop Page

In this project, I choose to create a music online shop with a 'main page with search option' and 'results' page.
I used a lot of knowledge acquired throughout the HTML & CSS section, such as semantic HTML, positioning of content with bootstrap, and flexbox among others. Also for learning purposes and to see if I could use different frameworks used 'Flickity' to build a carousel (just on a minor element to see it working, I didn't want to abuse it because I wanted to show more CSS skills learned through Microverse HTML & CSS section).
Worked for the requirements on two different main versions, showing the content as required, one for fullscreen >= 768px another for < 768px. I saw that I could improve it a little more on smaller screens, so I worked with some adjustments when a screen became less than 576px.
